![Tests](https://github.com/jesp1999/heckbot/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

A for-fun Discord bot with a variety of text-based features

Currently supports an !associate <keyword> <emoji> command which will cause the bot to react to any message containing keyword. Also has !dissociate <keyword> and !dissociate <keyword> <emoji> to undo this. Not super efficient, will look into improving speed next.
